# Regression-Analysis-of-AirBnB-Prices-in-Spain

This repository is for the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree. In the seventh project of the degree, you are tasked with writing a Data Science blogpost on a subject of your choosing. The main purpose of this proejct is to showcase the CRISP-DM (cross-industry process for data mining). I went with one of the suggested topics of answering business questions AirBnB. This repository contains the datasets used, and the jupyter notebook containing exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, and modelling.
