# Regression-Analysis-of-AirBnB-Prices-in-Spain

This repository is for the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree. In the seventh project, Write a Data Science Blog Post, you are tasked with writing a Data Science blogpost on a subject of your choosing. The main purpose of this proejct is to showcase the CRISP-DM (cross-industry process for data mining). I went with one of the suggested topics of answering business questions AirBnB. This repository contains the datasets used, and the jupyter notebook containing exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, and modelling. 

Datasets have been provided by insideairbnb.com

The blog post can be found on Medium.com here: []

For this project, I sought out to answer the following questions about the AirBnB data for Barcelona, Madrid, and Valencia:

1. How does pricing compare among all 3 cities throughout the year? Can we identify a 'peak' season of prices?

2. Where are the highest average listing prices in each city?

3. What features of an AirBnB listing influence price for major cities in Spain?

4. Are there features that influence price differently for each city?

The first two questions will be answered through descriptive statistics and appropriate visualizations. The third and fourth questions will involve a Linear Regression model, which will be chosen from the Scikit-Learn Library.
