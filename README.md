# Regression-Analysis-of-AirBnB-Prices-in-Spain

This repository is for the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree. In the seventh project of the degree, you are tasked with writing a Data Science blogpost on a subject of your choosing. The main purpose of this proejct is to showcase the CRISP-DM (cross-industry process for data mining). I went with one of the suggested topics of answering business questions AirBnB. This repository contains the datasets used, and the jupyter notebook containing exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, and modelling. 

Datasets have been provided by insideairbnb.com

The blog post can be found on Medium.com here: []

For this project, I sought out to answer some basic questions about the AirBnB data. 

1. What features of an Airbnb listing influence the listing price in popular Spanish cities (Barcelona, Madrid, Valencia?

2. Are there features unique to each city (eg. specific neighbourhoods) which influence prices?
  Sub-question: are there are any features found in all 3 cities that are more important in one city than the others?

3. What is the distribution of average listing prices for each city throughout the year?
  Sub-questions: can we identify a 'peak' season for each city? Is this season the same for all three?
